This is an open source project.  If you are interested in how it works, or would like to add your
own modules, check out the source at our web site, http://ilanguage.ca.
\n\n
New in this version: Eyes free widget, automatic import of machine transcription.
\n\n
Also note that the app sends anonymous statistics back to a server to detect frequent user functions which should be automated.  If youâ€™d rather not
allow that, you can turn it off in the settings screen. </string>



<string name="whats_new_ticker">In previous versions: Full data export. Record long dictations. This version: automatic speech recognition services for long dictations, eyes free widget.</string>
